# portfolio-2025
This repository contains my personal portfolio website, built to showcase my skills, projects, and services in a modern, responsive design. The site is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and leverages Bootstrap 5 for layout, Boxicons for icons, and Typed.js for dynamic text animations. A theme toggle button allows visitors to switch between dark and light modes, all powered by CSS variables.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** Built with Bootstrap 5 to ensure a mobile-friendly experience.
- **Dark/Light Theme Toggle:** Easily switch between dark and light modes using CSS variables.
- **Dynamic Text Animation:** Animated text in the hero section powered by Typed.js.
- **Interactive Cards:** Services and Projects sections utilize Bootstrap cards with smooth hover effects.
- **Social Media Integration:** Clickable icons link to Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn profiles.
